/**
 * The state of the state machine, capturing the state of a flow. It consists of two parts, an *immutable* part that is
 * persisted to the database ([Checkpoint]), and the rest, which is an in-memory-only state.
 *
 * @param checkpoint the persisted part of the state.
 * @param flowLogic the [FlowLogic] associated with the flow. Note that this is mutable by the user.
 * @param pendingDeduplicationHandlers the list of incomplete deduplication handlers.
 * @param isFlowResumed true if the control is returned (or being returned) to "user-space" flow code. This is used
 *   to make [Event.DoRemainingWork] idempotent.
 * @param isWaitingForFuture true if the flow is waiting for the completion of a future triggered by one of the statemachine's actions
 * @param future If the flow is relying on a [Future] completing, then this field will be set otherwise it remains null
 * @param isAnyCheckpointPersisted true if at least a single checkpoint has been persisted. This is used to determine
 *   whether we should DELETE the checkpoint at the end of the flow.
 * @param isStartIdempotent true if the start of the flow is idempotent, making the skipping of the initial checkpoint
 *   possible.
 * @param isRemoved true if the flow has been removed from the state machine manager. This is used to avoid any further
 *   work.
 * @param isKilled true if the flow has been marked as killed. This is used to cause a flow to move to a killed flow transition no matter
 * what event it is set to process next. [isKilled] is a `var` and set as [Volatile] to prevent concurrency errors that can occur if a flow
 * is killed during the middle of a state transition.
 * @param senderUUID the identifier of the sending state machine or null if this flow is resumed from a checkpoint so that it does not participate in de-duplication high-water-marking.
